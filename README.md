# Dagger2_RxAndroid
Dependency injection is a software design pattern in which one or more dependencies (or services) are injected, or passed by reference, into a dependent object (or client) and are made part of the client's state. The pattern separates the creation of a client's dependencies from its own behavior, which allows program designs to be loosely coupled and to follow the dependency inversion and single responsibility principles.

Dagger 2 is a compile-time evolution approach to dependency injection. Taking the approach started in Dagger 1.x to its ultimate conclusion, Dagger 2.0 eliminates all reflection, and improves code clarity by removing the traditional ObjectGraph/Injector in favor of user-specified @Component interfaces.
